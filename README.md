# Facial Recognition Attendance

This application reflects my implementation of open source facial recognition software with real-world use cases. This is a project completed during my first semester of a two semester capstone project during my undergraduate education. Here, I build a full stack react/django app to allow for classroom management via automated facial recognition. 

The basic use case of this application is to allow for a professor or class leader to add in information about a particular class or section, along with student pictures, and each day the students would check in by having their face scanned at the computer. This helps ensure validity of attendance in that an individual cannot attend a class for someone else. Additionally, it eliminates the need for tedious time spent calling names or having students sign in through some other means.
